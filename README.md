The program takes in data copied directly from an e-mail table and put in the input file.
Then using the data stored in the Internals/Pricing.xlsx and fills a copy of a data form stored in Internals/EmptyOrder.xlsx
The data form is then outputed in a form of a Order.xlsx.
If the Order.xlsx file does not exist one will be created.
If it exists it will be overwriten with new order data.
Order.xlsx is also copied, numbered and then placed in the PastOrders folder.

Sample data is included in the input.txt file.
If you wish to input your own data just delete its contents.
